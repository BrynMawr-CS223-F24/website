=== Late Policy

Because practice is so important for learning how to program, we will do frequent 
exercises, assignments, and quizzes throughout the term.

The purpose of this work is to give you hands on experience with the topics
from class. Most of this work will be due in lecture or labs. The  
weekly time commitment for this course is aimed to be approximately 10 hours per week.

Assignments will generally be due on Wednesdays. However, you may request up to *one* late 
days (until Thursday) if necessary. No submissions beyond Thursday will be accepted.
This allows us time to grade assignments. And it helps prevent you from falling 
behind.

If you need to miss a code jam, let the instructor know and the missed credit for the code jam 
will be added to the final exam. 

You may need to provide a doctor's note if you need special accomodations due to a 
medical emergency.
