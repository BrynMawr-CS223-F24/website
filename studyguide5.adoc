= Practice questions

//== Compiling and linking
//
//1) Short answers
//
//* What is the difference between compiling and linking?
//* What is a library? When would you use one?
//* What are differences between an application and a library?
//* What is the difference between static and dynamic libraries? Why might you want to use one over the other?
//* What does the pre-processor do?
//* What is the purpose of compiling and linking?
//
//2) Ann-marie has the following errors when she tried to build. What type of error is it (compile, link, runtime, or logical)? How can she fix it?
//
//[source]
//----
///usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccH1QHw0.o: in function `main':
//thread-argv.c:(.text+0x1c4): undefined reference to `pthread_attr_setstacksize'
///usr/bin/ld: thread-argv.c:(.text+0x2e4): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
///usr/bin/ld: thread-argv.c:(.text+0x38d): undefined reference to `pthread_join'
//collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
//----

//4) Tymothy would like to create a library for creating color pallettes. The
//functions in their library would have the following APIs. 
//
//[source]
//----
//struct ppm_pixel {
//  union {
//    struct {
//      unsigned char red;
//      unsigned char green;
//      unsigned char blue;
//    };
//    unsigned char colors[3];
//  };
//};
//
//// Creates and initializes a pallet with the given number of random colors
//struct ppm_pixel* create_pallette(int size);
//
//// Frees the memory associated with the given pallette
//void delete_pallette(struct ppm_pixel* pallette);
//----
//
//* How can Tymothy use `ar` to create a static library?
//* How can Tymothy use `gcc` to create a shared library?
//* How might Tymothy implement the given functions?
//* Are the commands for building a library different
//* What is the difference between a header file (.h) and an implementation file (*.c)? 
//* How can Tymothy use the functions in their library? Write a program that tests the pallet function.

== Advanced pointers

1) Draw a stack diagram for the following program. Show all intermediate values.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int vals[4] = {1,2,3,4};

  printf("-------\n");
  for (int* ptr = vals; ptr < vals+4; ptr++) {
    printf("%p %d\n", ptr, *ptr);
  }

  return 0;
}
----

2) Fix the error in the following program. Then draw the function stack and heap for the working program.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  void *gen_ptr;
  int x = 3;
  char ch = 'a';

  gen_ptr = &x;  // gen_ptr can be assigned the address of an int
  gen_ptr = &ch; // or the address of a char (or the address of any type)

  int* int_ptr;
  int_ptr = &x;

  printf("The int value is %d\n", *int_ptr);
  printf("The char value is %c\n", *gen_ptr);
  return 0;
}
----

3) Fix the error in the following program. Then draw the function stack and heap for the working program.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int* value = NULL;
  printf("value is %d\n", *value);

  int a = 4;
  value = &a;
  printf("value is %d\n", *value);
}
----

4) Draw the stack and heap diagram for the following program.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct headerT {
  int a;
  int b;
};

struct studentT {
  char name[64];
  int age;
  float gpa;
};

int main() {

  void* data = malloc(sizeof(struct headerT) + 2 * sizeof(struct studentT));
  struct headerT* header = (struct headerT*) data;
  header->a = 5;
  header->b = 7;

  struct studentT* student = (struct studentT*) (header + 1);
  strncpy(student->name, "Bill", 4);
  student->age = 18;
  student->gpa = 3.3;

  student++;
  strncpy(student->name, "Carol", 5);
  student->age = 22;
  student->gpa = 3.6;

  free(data);
  // draw the stack and heap here
  return 0;
}
----

== Memory

1) Short answers

* What is the memory hierarchy?
//* Why do computers have a memory hierachy?
//* What is a cache hit? A cache miss?
* What are some examples of primary storage?
* What are some examples of secondary storage?
* What is locality and what impact does it have on performance? 
* What is sbrk()? Why do we use functions such as malloc and free, rather than call sbrk() directly from our programs?
//* What is memory fragmentation and how can it occur?

2) In the following code, which variables have temporal locality? spatial locality?

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i, size = 0;

    // declare array of 10 ints
    int my_arr[10];

    // set the value of each array element
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        my_arr[i] = i;
        size++;
    }

    // set value at position 3 to 100
    my_arr[3] = 100;

    // print the number of array elements
    printf("array of %d items:\n", size);

    // print each element of the array
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", my_arr[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
----

3) Is the following program guaranteed to have good spatial locality? Why or why not?

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void init_matrix(int** m, int rows, int cols) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {  // for each row i
    for (j = 0; j < cols; j++) { // iterate over each column in row i
        m[i][j] = 0;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int nrows = 50;
  int ncols = 100;

  int** matrix = malloc(sizeof(int*) * nrows);
  for (int i = 0; i < nrows; i++) {
    matrix[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * ncols);
  }

  init_matrix(matrix, nrows, ncols);

  for (int i = 0; i < nrows; i++) {
    free(matrix[i]);
  }
  free(matrix);
  matrix = NULL;
  return 0;
}
----

== OS, Processes

1) Short answer

* What is the operating system?
* What is the BIOS or UEFI for?
* What is virtual address space (VAS)? Why is it useful?
* What is a process? 
* What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?
* Why do we need interrupts and traps?
* Why do we need special mechanisms, such as pipes or sockets, to communicate between processes?
* How can you kill a process using `ps` ?
* What states can a process be in?
* What is a zombie process?
* Why might we want to register a signal handler for the SIGKILL or SIGSEGV signal?
* When does the OS send the SIGSEGV signal?
//* What are the differences between shared memory, signals and pipes?

2) The following program creates a zombie process. Why?

[source]
----
void main() {
  if (fork() == 0) { /*child */
    printf("Child, PID = %d\n", getpid());
    exit(0);
  } else { /*parent */
    printf("Parent, PID = %d\n", getpid());
    while(1) {
    }
  }
}
----

3) Draw the process hierarchy created by executing the following program. For each process in the hierarchy, list its output (e.g. what does each process print)?

[source]
----
int main() {
  pid_t ret;

  printf("A\n");

  ret = fork();
  if(ret == 0) {
    printf("B\n");

    ret = fork();
    if(ret == 0) {
      printf("C\n");
    }
    printf("D\n");
  } else {
    printf("E\n");

    ret = fork();
    printf("F\n");
  }

  printf("G\n");
  return 0;
}
----

4) What type of event does SIGINT represent? Write a program that registers a signal handler for SIGINT?
