= {title}

**Due Thursday, Oct 20, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Directly manipulate basic types at the bit level using masks
* Directly manipulate basic types at the bit level
* Work with binary files

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

NOTE: Install the VS Code extension, "PBM/PPM/PGM Viewer" by ngtystr, so you can easily view your PPM files!

== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `A02`.

= Tiny Bitmaps

A link:https://sneslab.net/wiki/Graphics_Format[1bpp], or 1-bit-per-pixel, 
sprite stores a grid of black and white pixels using a single bit. 0 denotes 
white and 1 denotes black.

In the program, `bitmap.c`, implement a program that reads in a single 64-bit 
unsigned integer (e.g. `unsigned long`) and outputs it as an 8x8 1bpp sprite.

Requirements/Hints:

* Your program should *must* use a bitmask! For example, to generate a 64-bit mask that obtains the left-most bit, do `0x1ul << 63`. The `ul` indicates an `unsigned long` value. `0x1` is the number one in hexadecimal.
* The bitmap files store the values as hexadecimal values. To read them in, do `unsigned long img; scanf(" %lx", &img);`. Use `%lx` for printf also. You are given basecode that reads in the long integer from stdin.

= Write PPM

Implement a new function, `write_ppm`, defined in `write_ppm.c`. 
Similarly to link:asst04.html[Assignment 04], you should choose one definition of `write_ppm` to 
implement, depending on whether you use either a "flat array" or an "array of arrays" to store your pixels. 

The file, `test_write_ppm.c`, tests your write function if you implemented a 1D array.
The file, `test_write_ppm_2d.c`, tests your write function if you implemented a 2D array.
If it is working correctly, you should see the following output.

$ **make test_ppm**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror test_ppm.c write_ppm.C read_ppm.c -o test_ppm
$ **./test_ppm**
Testing file feep-raw.ppm: 4 4
(0,0,0) (100,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,255)
(0,0,0) (0,255,175) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,15,175) (0,0,0)
(255,0,255) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,255,255)

Requirements/Hints:

* Use `fprintf` to write the header and `fwrite` to write the binary Data to your file.

= Glitch

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art[Glitch Art] is the practice of leveraging technological errors for artistic purposes. Some cool examples can be found here by link:https://mobile.twitter.com/glitchartbot[glitchartbot].

Then write a program, `glitch.c`, that reads in a PPM file and "glitches" it. Your program should save the modified PPM in a new file with the suffix "-glitch". For example, if you load in the file 
"monalisa.ppm", you should output a file named "monalisa-glitch.ppm".

|=== 


Requirements/Hints:

* Save the result to `<filename>-glitch.ppm`
* To start, implement a minimal glitch, which shifts each color value by either 1 or 2 bits, choosen at random, e.g. `newcolorvalue = oldcolorvalue << (rand() % 2);`. Your result should look like
* Submit your glitched images as part of your submission!

Feel free to be creative with your glitches. You can use a combination of bit operations, switching colors, adding colors, etc.  Anything goes! Also, feel free to use your own images. PPM images can be exported using link:https://www.gimp.org[Gimp] or Photoshop.
