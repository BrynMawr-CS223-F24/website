= {title}

**Due Friday, November 1, at midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement an algorithm using multiple processes with fork()
* Implement your own simple shell program

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/master`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Warm-up

In the file, `warmup.c`, implement a program that spawns processes according to the following diagram.

$ **make warmup**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror warmup.c -o warmup

Requirements:

* Your program should print the messages as shown above.
* Your program should use fork() to spawn processes.
* Call `getpid()` to show the process ids for each print message.

= Simple Shell

In the file, `shell.c`, implement a program that implements a simple shell. 

Requirements:

* TODO
* todo

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (1 points) Warmup
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) prints correct messages, uses fork() and getpid()
** (0.5 points) no memory errors
* (3 points) Simple shell 
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (1.4 points) 
** (1.5 points) no memory errors

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
